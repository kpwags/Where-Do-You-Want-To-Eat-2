    <h2 class="mt-5">First, A Little History</h2>
    <p>Several years ago, I built a little website that I named Where Do You Want To Eat?.
        It was a simple little app that tied into Google's Geolocation API to find a restaurant near you, or by a specified
        Zip Code for you to eat at. It randomly chose it to help friends or couples choose their next meal.</p>

    <p>Google changed their API and started charging for it (which is completely fair, I'm not going to complain.). But
        because the site had no revenue and since there'd be the chance for a spike of usage jacking up the API costs, I opted
        to sunset it. You can still view the <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">What This Is</h2>
    <p>This .NET Core MVC web app is going to be it's replacement, at least in spirit. I'm building it to replace the first version,
        but instead of using a geolocation API, I'm allowing users to sign up to create their own little database of restaurants to
        randomly choose from. To make it a little more user-friendly, I'm adding tags for restaurants so users can filter the
        output some.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">About the Developer</h2>
    <p>My name is Keith, I’m a 35 year old web developer living in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I graduated from
        Drexel University in 2007 with my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and have since spent my career working on both
        front-end and back-end development. I am fortunate to have found a career where I can do what I love doing. Seeing
        websites and applications come to life is such an awesome thing, even more so when you’re the one building them.</p>
