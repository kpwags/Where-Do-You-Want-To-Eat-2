    <h2 class="mt-5">First, A Little History</h2>
    <p>Several years ago, I built a little website <a href="https://wheredoyouwanttoeat.xyz">Where Do You Want To Eat?</a>.
        It was a simple little app that tied into Google's Geolocation API to find a restaurant near you, or by a specified
        Zip Code for you to eat at. It randomly chose it to help friends or couples choose their next meal.</p>

    <p>Google changed their API and started charging for it (which is completely fair, I'm not going to complain.). But
        because the site had no revenue and since there'd be the chance for a spike of usage jacking up the API costs, I opted
        to sunset it. You can still view the <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">What This Is</h2>
    <p>This .NET Core MVC web app is going to be it's replacement, at least in spirit. I'm building it to replace the first version,
        but instead of using a geolocation API, I'm allowing users to sign up to create their own little database of restaurants to
        randomly choose from. To make it a little more user-friendly, I'm adding tags for restaurants so users can filter the
        output some.</p>
    <p>It's going to be a little bit of a learning project for me as it's my first real foray into .NET Core. I've built apps for
        .NET Framework, but this is a bit new.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned...</p>
