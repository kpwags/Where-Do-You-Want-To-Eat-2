# Where Do You Want To Eat v2

_(I don't care, where do you want to eat?)_

## First, A Little History

Several years ago, I built a little website. It was a simple little app that tied into Google's Geolocation API to find a restaurant near you, or by a specified Zip Code for you to eat at. It randomly chose it to help friends or couples choose their next meal.

Google changed their API and started charging for it (which is completely fair, I'm not going to complain.). But because the site had no revenue and since there'd be the chance for a spike of usage upping the API costs, I opted to sunset it. You can still view the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat).

## What This Is

This is the source code for [Where Do You Want To Eat?](https://wheredoyouwanttoeat.xyz). Where Do You Want to Eat is a web app that chooses where you go out to eat. We've all been there with friends and/or family. Trying to find a place to go and no one can decide or agree. This web app allows you to create an account, add restaurants, tag them, and let it choose where to go grab food.

## Technologies Used

Where Do You Want to Eat is built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It uses Bootstrap for the UI.
