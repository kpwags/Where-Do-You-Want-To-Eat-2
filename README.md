# Where Do You Want To Eat v2

*(I don't care, where do you want to eat?)*

## First, A Little History
Several years ago, I built a little website [Where Do You Want To Eat?](https://wheredoyouwanttoeat.xyz). It was a simple little app that tied into Google's Geolocation API to find a restaurant near you, or by a specified Zip Code for you to eat at. It randomly chose it to help friends or couples choose their next meal.

Google changed their API and started charging for it (which is completely fair, I'm not going to complain.). But because the site had no revenue and there'd be the chance for a spike of usage jacking up the API costs, I opted to scuttle it. You can still view the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat).

## What This Is

This .NET Core MVC web app is going to be it's replacement, at least in spirit. I'm building it to replace the first version, but instead of using a geolocation API, I'm allowing users to sign up to create their own little database of restaurants to randomly choose from. To make it a little more user-friendly, I'm adding tags for restaurants so users can filter the output some.

It's going to be a little bit of a learning project for me as it's my first real foray into .NET Core. I've built apps for .NET Framework, but this is a bit new.

Stay tuned...
